Last year, on November 20 2017, I married this guy:

Because he's Punjabi, I ended up going to India 3 times over the last year. During one of those trips,
one of Shiv's (my husband) aunties told us one of the best scary stories.

So about 60 years ago or so, Shiv's great uncles (or great great?) were walking home through the jungle
after a long day of work. They're tired, hungry, and just ready to lay down.

Soon they come across a wedding celebration, and as most of you know weddings in India are really big.
The brothers decided to try their best to blend in and take a seat on the ground to get some wedding food.

They were each handed a bowl and they held the bowls up with their heads down as they waited for the servant
to reach them. When he arrived, the first thing they saw were his feet: they were facing the wrong direction,
as if they were two clubfeet. Then they looked up at the man as he spooned some sweets into their bowl. His
face looked hideous, menacing and angry. The intense sensation of panic and dread descended on the brothers
and they all jumped up and ran for their lives, holding the bowls.

When they reached the house, the sweets were gone and the bowls were filled with maggots.
